My name is Saeed, and I have been working as a software engineer since 2010. Over the years, I have worked with many clients and companies and completed numerous projects and successfully launched them into production. I am designing and developing multi-platform applications. I love open-source and have done many open-source projects and still maintaining and developing many of them.

I started this blog to write about stuff that Iâ€™ve learned so far and share my experiences with the universe

I will write about anything related to Programming, mostly about PHP, Laravel, and Javascript.
