After searching on the Internet for websites that provide a service for getting more information about IP addresses, Like what country they belong to, I decided to create a free one!

### What is an IP API

Sometimes we need to know where our users come from, Geolocational I mean. To do this we need to have access to an IP Database to fetch usersâ€™ locations according to their IP address.

We have two options here:

- Get your hands dirty and download those databases (some are free) and implement them in your code and keep the database updated because the IP Databases are changing repeatedly.
- Let experts do this for you ðŸ™‚ and you just call some API and receive the data in the response.

The second option is called IP API.

### What is this post about?

As you can guess, I am going to introduce something to you :). Long story short, I created [freeipapi.com](https://freeipapi.com/). A free forever IP API.

### But there are plenty of websites like this

Yes. I googled so much about it but I couldnâ€™t find an absolutely [free IP API](http://freeipapi.com/) on the web so they allow you to use it in your commercial projects!

Feel free to use this in your all projects ðŸŽ‰

### Not open-source

This website is not an open-source project; however, The tool that I used in it is open-source!

Check the [IP2Location](https://github.com/saeedvaziry/ip2location) package on my Github.

I really enjoy creating useful tools for developers ðŸ™‚
