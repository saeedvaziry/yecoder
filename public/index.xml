      <description>It was a long time ago I wanted to write this post and show you how to set up a docker-compose with all you need to have a separate logging system.
Logging is a meaningful way to monitor your applicationâ€™s behavior. When it comes to production and having multiple servers running one application in different instances, You might want to have a unified logging system to check them all in one place.</description>

      <description>So most of you might know this, Specially you old-school PHP developers ðŸ™‚ but itâ€™s not gonna fill the internetâ€™s capacity so let me be happy by writing this post.
You might have seen some PHPUnit tests with arguments! Have you asked yourself how itâ€™s possible and who sends those arguments to these tests? The answer is simple! Data Providers
With PHPUnit, you can define arguments for your test function, and in the DocBlock you mention that there is a data provider for this function, and inside that function just provide the data ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>Imagine yourself in a big team coding on a single project. In our scenario the project is Laravel. There would be tens of Pull Requests waiting to merge but you need to make sure that nothing goes wrong after the merge. Obviously, youâ€™ll have tests in your project but it would be very tricky to go through the all PRs and run the tests on your local.
GitHub Actions Thanks to GitHub there is a feature called Actions that comes in handy in this case.</description>

      <description>Laravel Monitoring is a package by myself so you can monitor your Laravel applicationâ€™s server resources like CPU, Disk, and Memory
This package provides a beautiful dashboard with a fancy chart showing the serverâ€™s resource usage from one hour to a day.
Multi-Server support The amazing part of this package which is my favorite part also, Is you can see monitor all of your servers in one place!
For example, consider that you have several servers running the same source code.</description>

      <title>Laravel Custom Helpers, Facades, and Testing Fakes</title>

      <guid>https://yecoder.com/posts/laravel-custom-helpers-facades-and-testing-fakes/</guid>
      <description>Letâ€™s consider that we want to create a custom helper named SSH. This helper is going to connect to a remote server via ssh and execute some commands.
Commands Since we might have many commands, I would create an interface first.
// app/Commands/Command.php namespace App\SSHCommands; use App\Contracts\SSHCommand; interface Command { public function content(); } And then an example command.
// app/Commands/DirectoryListCommand.php namespace App\SSHCommands; use App\Contracts\SSHCommand; class DirectoryListCommand implements Command { public function content() { return &amp;#34;ls -la&amp;#34;; } } Helper Alright.</description>

      <description>After searching on the Internet for websites that provide a service for getting more information about IP addresses, Like what country they belong to, I decided to create a free one!
What is an IP API Sometimes we need to know where our users come from, Geolocational I mean. To do this we need to have access to an IP Database to fetch usersâ€™ locations according to their IP address.</description>
